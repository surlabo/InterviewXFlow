/* Main difference between first and second examples is that CheatManager in first has Extensible design
which allows us to register new cheatProviders without changing codebase with the help of interface ICheatProvider.

Also CheaActionDescription encapsulates all necessary data that we need to pass around. 

first example is superior in every way and i would leave it as it is, if i didn't miss minor mistakes */
